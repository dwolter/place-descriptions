Data for evaluating methods for interpreting paraphrased place descriptions. The task is to identify the correct OSM tag used in the OSM database that correspond to the place described. The complete list of tags is given in osm_tags_complete.txt. The data in full_input_tokens.txt is organized line-by-line: one line lists all context nouns (e.g., tea, cupcakes), the following line the correct OSM tag (e.g., cafe). Complete sentences are described in groundtruth-type-full.odt (LibreOffice document).
